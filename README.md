## Build Yourself

To build to project completly from scrach from remote machine, follow these instructions

1. Find and download a Training Dataset for Plant Disease. (Or feel free to use this dataset. Its the filtered and custom version of Village Plant Dataset)
2. Train a Model for each plant using CNN. (Source code is in Code directory)
3. Build an API which gets image and use the trained Model to predict the disease. Then it should return the disease name and other relavant infos.
4. Deploy the API and build an Web UI which sits top in the API
